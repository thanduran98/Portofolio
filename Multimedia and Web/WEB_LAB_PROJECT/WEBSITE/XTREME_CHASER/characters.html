                                The villages along the Arit river on the Punjab border were proud of their guardian. Proud and more than a little scared. The Tiger was a gift from Rama, they said, though a gift rarely seen. Years might pass with only a giant paw print in the mud of the riverbank to prove that The Tiger still prowled the forests between the villages.
                                <br><br> But when raiders from the north or soldiers from the south came to steal and oppress, the signs of The Tiger would appear -- bodies of invaders high in the trees, a would-be warlord mauled in his tent, an entire brigand camp shattered as though a typhoon had struck. And the villagers would wonder that anyone was left in the world so ignorant or so arrogant as to be heedless of their protector.
                                <br><br> As for the The Tiger, she barely remembered being a girl. She remembered being twelve and discovering with horror that her once noble family, anointed protectors of the valley, now grew richer when outsiders came to plunder. She remembered her wicked uncle lashing her to the temple altar and conjuring the tiger spirit to devour her. And she remembered fighting - fighting so long and so hard that in the end she didn't know who had devoured whom.
                                <br><br> In Valhalla, Asuri has claimed the Tournament as her territory, and sets upon challengers to her domain with savage fury.

                                Great oracles are rare because by the time a witch has toiled through the many grueling years required to master Starspeak, they've almost certainly lost the charm and positive attitude needed for start to want to talk to them. Fait's greatest power was most likely her unwavering good-nature.
                                <br><br> As a young witch Fait would hang out with the stars at night, who gave her fleeting visions of past, present, and future. In daylight, she made ends meet selling fortunes on the streets of Edasich. As her power grew, she learned to deduce a human's fate from the smallest visions.
                                <br><br> But when the mighty Deathspeaker Lord Zothkhan arose, Fait transformed herself into a battlemage to oppose his monstrous army. The world soon learned just how powerful even the smallest glimpse of the future could be in battle. Her vision of the Invulnerable Pit Fiend facedown with a scythe blade buried in his weak spot spelled his doom. Her foresight of a flattened werewolf led her to lure the vampire general into Avalanche Gulch.
                                <br><br> And a vision of a lava-scorched Lord Zothkhan in the afterlife, retrieving his beloved cat from its demon caretaker, prompted her to bring her own cat Butterscotch as a distraction to her showdown with the Deathspeaker on a bridge over Mount Inferno.
                                <br><br> When Brynn came to offer her a place in Valhalla, Fait had already packed. In Valhalla Fait is popular, and has joined a band, a book club, and wins big on poker nights.

                                Hundreds of years of war and plague had reduced the once mighty Empire of the Jaguar Kingdom to a shadow of its former glory. Neither the brilliant battlefield victories nor the cunning sorcery of the great Queen Nai could stem the tide of decline of her people or of her gods - a once great pantheon now faded to near extinction.
                                <br><br> Seeing that her civilization's doom was sealed, Nai made a plan. She cast a spell, drawing into herself the essence of the eleven surviving gods of the Jaguar Kingdom. And when, during the Battle of Ixanocala, a Valkyrie offered Nai a place in Valhalla, she accepted, carrying Xanlecutli the Coatl, Eba the Snake, and nine other ailing gods with her to the great hall.
                                <br><br> In Valhalla, Nai is a consummate warrior and has grown to love the place. Yet she never loses sight of her purpose - her victories nourish the gods of her people, and little by little they recover. Nai believes tales of Ragnarok represent Asgardians' dim understanding that creation is cyclical and that Asgard must be destroyed for the world to be renewed and for her gods to rule again.

                                Zariel is on a mission from God - specifically the god Paladium, the warrior deity of Holy Justice who abides in blessed Elysium. In Elysium too, Zariel resided, a saintly soldier in Paladium’s perfect celestial army that stands ready to fight the demon hordes that will one day be released from Gehenna.
                                <br><br> Ages ago, Elysium was visited by the leader of another pantheon - Odin the All-Father. The Viking God was impressed by Paladium’s mighty host - and jealous. Returning to asgard, Odin sent out his valkyries to raise his own army for the end-times. Naturally, Paladium scoffed - no boorish viking horde could ever match his most excellent and holy host.
                                <br><br> But recently, Paladium has heard rumors that the valkyries’ intense rivalry to bring back the best warriors has borne fruit. And he’s heard whispers that through the chaos and nonsense of the Grand Tournament of Valhalla, Odin’s ragtag army of the afterlife has forged itself into a formidable force. Paladium has sent Zariel to investigate.
                                <br><br> In Valhalla, Zariel entered the tournament to take the measure of this motley crew. However, the battles of the Grand Tournament hold an allure for any warrior, and Zariel’s emotionless participation is starting to give way to fun.

                                Any Valkyrie could see that the blind seamstress was a centuries old fox spirit in disguise. Only the half-Valkyrie saw a great Valhallan.
                                <br><br> From time immemorial the Japanese village of Aoku sat at peace on the edge of the edge of the great northern forest. Then the forest changed. The winters grew bitter, and the cold seemed to flow out of the forest itself. From the forest too came great wolves - first in ones and twos and then in great packs. The forest came to be called Kiba, The Fang, and the villagers feared.
                                <br><br> To villagers, Yumiko, the blind seamstress, was a happy soul - afraid of dogs, and roused to anger only by shoddy needlework. None ever knew that, at the age of 537, she picked up a bow for the first time and went to war with the monsters of the Kiba.
                                <br><br> The first winter, she rescued a toddler from a wandering wolf, the second winter she slew a pack of wolves to protect the hibernating Tororu. Year after year, the assault grew, and so did her skill. By the twenty-fifth year, she had defeated a Tengu army, slain a dragon, and realized she must confront this mystery at its source.
                                <br><br> Weary but determined, she traveled deep into the woods. There she fought the witch Ukionna and broke the bond between Yumiko's world and the twisted forest corrupting her land. In the final moments of the battle, a valkyrie appeared. Without a word, Yumiko leapt on the flying horse and went happily to sleep.
                                <br><br> Yumiko is happy to fight in the tournament, while she senses that she has one more great deed to accomplish, but waits patiently. Yumiko recoils at the sight of Mordex, tinkers with Scarlet in her workshop, and has a quiet bond with the enigmatic Asuri.

                                Watching from the doors of Valhalla, Bodvar, Cassidy and the other legends saw a blazing trail of smoke cut across the Asgardian sky. Behind the fiery comet, a Valkyrie raced in pursuit, as though trying to stop the fireball as it plunged into the fields of Folkvangr in a gout of dirt and flame. The legends then watched as Valkyries and emissaries of Odin gathered around the smoking crater.
                                <br><br> Weeks later, the sons of Ivaldi, the same dwarven smiths who had forged Odin's spear, quietly appeared in Asgard, they bore a suit of dazzling golden armor and presented it to the gods themselves. Soon after, the mighty Orion joined the feast halls of Valhalla.
                                <br><br> Tentative and aloof at first, Orion soon warmed to the great hall and is now among it's greatest warriors and most popular champions. Orion does not speak of his past, and other legends can only speculate. But Valkyries stop by his chambers to ask if he wants to, "you know, hang out or whatever, no big deal." He is the only hero seen to leave Asgard from time to time.

                                For a thousand years, the Order of the Exalted Lion has defended mundane society from the supernatural with a trademark combination of elite training and exotic weaponry.
                                <br><br> As the commander of the Order’s hunters, Diana drove Europe’s vampire population into exile and eliminated the self-appointed Unseelie Diplomat. She slew the Mad King of Batavia, then slew the Vampire Mad King of Batavia, then finally slew the Ghost Vampire Mad King of Batavia.
                                <br><br> She is the national hero of Batavia. But when she uncovered corruption in the Order itself, Diana fell into a trap. Breaking into the chambers of the Supreme Patriarch, Diana was seized by dark magic that drove her into a deathlike sleep. She fought for moments of wakefulness – catching a glimpse of the Order’s subbasements, of a winding forest of thorns, and finally of an expanse of darkness filled with screams.
                                <br><br> Diana awoke on the shores of Nastrond, a land deep within Helheim. The endless dead sensed the unfamiliar warmth of mortality and swarmed to consume it. And so she fought. She held the damned at bay for eleven days before the Goddess Hel herself found her and ejected the troublemaker. A Valkyrie found Diana lost between worlds, and offered her a place in Valhalla.
                                <br><br> In Valhalla, Diana is a ruthless combatant and a force for justice. But she seethes that monsters like Azoth and Mordex are allowed in the warrior’s heaven, and plots their destruction.
